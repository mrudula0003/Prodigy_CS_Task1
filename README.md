# 👾Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
Internship Task 1 at Prodigy InfoTech 

## Overview🧐

This repository contains two Python programs that implement the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text. Users can input a message and a shift value to perform the encryption and decryption operations. The Caesar Cipher is a classic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

### Theoretical Explanation🤔

The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' would be encrypted as 'D', 'B' as 'E', and so on. The decryption process reverses the shift. This algorithm is a simple form of encryption and serves as an introduction to the concepts of cryptography and cybersecurity.

### 🕵️‍♀️Cybersecurity Concepts

- **Encryption**🔒: The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext to protect information from unauthorized access.
- **Decryption**🔓: The process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext.
- **Cipher**🧩: An algorithm for performing encryption and decryption.
- **Key**🗝️: A piece of information that determines the functional output of the cryptographic algorithm. In this case, the shift value.

## 📍Pre-requisites
👨🏻‍💻
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Python installed on your machine
- A text editor or Python IDE

## 📌Software Requirements

- Python 3.x
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm or VSCode

## 📌Hardware Requirements

- Any modern computer with at least 2GB of RAM
- Minimum of 200MB of free storage space

## Tech Stack🦾

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **IDE**: PyCharm (recommended, but any Python-compatible IDE can be used)

## 🚀Steps to Execute the Program

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone <[repository-url]> (https://github.com/mrudula0003/Prodigy_CS_Task1)
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   - Open the program in your Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm).
   - Execute the script `caesar_cipher.py`.
   - Follow the prompts to enter the text and the shift value.

3. **Example Execution**:
